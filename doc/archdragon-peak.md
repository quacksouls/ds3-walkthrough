# Archdragon Peak

You must have the Path of the Dragon gesture in order to access this area. You
should have collected the gesture after defeating Oceiros and _en route_ to the
Untended Graves bonfire.

Archdragon Peak is a small area, littered with Man Serpents who are weak against
lightning. By now your Raw Dragonslayer's Axe should have been upgraded to +10,
powerful enough to dispatch of a Man Serpent within a few hits. The most
dangerous type of enemy is the Giant Man Serpent.

The area boss is Ancient Wyvern, another gimmick fight. Don't fight the Wyvern
head-on. The game wants you to plunge attack the boss' head to kill it. To that
end, take the route shown in the above video to reach an elevated platform. You
don't need to fight any enemy along the way. Once you reach the stone elevated
platform shown in the video, wait until the Wyvern's head is directly underneath
you and plunge attack the boss' head to kill it.

Once Ancient Wyvern is defeated, you would be teleported to the next area. Don't
explore the area yet. Instead, warp to the Archdragon Peak bonfire and explore
the boss arena to collect treasures. Be sure to grab the Ring of Steel
Protection and equip it immediately.

You will need the Dragonslayer Greatbow as part of a cheese strategy to defeat
an upcoming mini-boss. Upgrade the Greatbow to at least +4. Your goal is to
level up to get 20 Strength and 20 Dexterity, the exact stats requirement for
properly wielding the Dragonslayer Greatbow. Purchase as many Dragonslayer
Greatarrows as possible, but 50 should be enough.
