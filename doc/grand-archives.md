# Grand Archives

Before you explore any further, light the Grand Archives bonfire. The Grand
Archives is difficult due to the following reasons, among others:

1. Crystal Sage. This is the second Crystal Sage, who now functions as a
   mini-boss. The Sage spawns as soon as you opened the double doors of the
   Grand Archives and proceed up the small flight of stairs. Defeat the
   mini-boss as soon as possible. While the Crystal Sage is alive, he would
   harass you as you explore the area. As shown in the next video, use the
   following strategy to easily kill the Sage. Return to Firelink Shrine, give
   the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome to Cornyx (if you haven't already done so),
   and purchase Poison Mist from him. Since our starting class is Deprived, we
   already have 10 Faith, the exact number of points required to use Poison
   Mist. Carry at least 10 Dung Pies; purchase from the Shrine Handmaid if
   necessary. Warp back to the Grand Archives bonfire, sit at the bonfire to
   attune Poison Mist, and equip Pyromancy Flame in your right hand. Position
   your character at the location shown in the video, lock on to the Sage, and
   cast Poison Mist. Once the mini-boss is poisoned, lock on to him again, and
   throw a few Dung Pies at him until he is also inflicted with toxic. Consume a
   Blooming Purple Moss Clump to remove your own toxic bar, but doing so is
   usually not necessary. Wait until the mini-boss is no longer toxic, then
   throw a few more Dung Pies to toxic him again. Wait a bit longer and the
   mini-boss should be dead, thus dropping you the Crystal Scroll.
1. Clawed Curse. These are ghostly arms, often found protruding from bookcases.
   Clawed Curses can quickly drain your HP as well as inflict curse. Three wax
   basins are scattered throughout the Grand Archives. Dunk your character's
   head into a wax basin to negate the effects of the Clawed Curses.
1. Gertrude's Knight. A more powerful version of the Winged Knights you have
   already encountered at High Wall of Lothric and near the Dragon Barracks
   bonfire. The three Gertrude's Knights are weak against lightning. You can
   also cast Rapport on one Knight to make it fight a nearby Knight. Purchase
   Rapport from Karla after you have given her the Quelana Pyromancy Tome. You
   require 15 Intelligence to use Rapport. As our starting class is Deprived, we
   already have 10 Intelligence. The remaining 5 points is obtained by equipping
   the Scholar Ring. By the time you reach the 3 Gertrude's Knights, you should
   already have picked up the Scholar Ring.

Make sure you grab these items:

-   Crystal Scroll. Guaranteed to drop after defeating the Crystal Sage
    mini-boss. Give this item to Orbeck.
-   Scholar Ring. This is hidden within a room walled by two bookcases. You must
    pull a lever to remove the bookcases.
-   Greirat's Ashes.
-   Undead Bone Shard. Found on a corpse, sitting and holding a book.
-   Titanite Slab x 3. One is found behind a bookcase; you must pull a lever to
    remove the bookcase. One is guaranteed to drop once you have defeated all
    three Gertrude's Knights for the first time. The third is found at the very
    bottom of a double-elevator puzzle. The elevators transport you to a
    location near the Dragonslayer Armour bonfire.
-   Estus Shard. Found near where the three Gertrude's Knights spawn.
-   Hunter's Ring. Found underneath where the three Gertrude's Knights spawn.

On your way to the three Gertrude's Knights, you would be ambushed by Albert,
Kamui, and Kriemhild. Don't fight them yet. Instead, unlock the nearby elevator
shortcut, return to Firelink Shrine, and give Orbeck all your sorcery scrolls.
In total, by now you should have given Orbeck four scrolls. Purchase all
sorceries from Orbeck and exhaust his dialogue to receive some items. In total,
you should have received two rings and a gesture. Exhaust his dialogue again,
warp back to Firelink Shrine again, and Orbeck should have left the Shrine,
meaning that his summon sign is available near the boss arena ready for you to
summon him for jolly co-operation. You should also level up to get 15 Faith and
14 Attunement. Further equipping the Deep Ring, or Saint's Ring, and Sunlight
Talisman would allow you to cast Tears of Denial. Next, clear all enemies
outside the boss arena. Finally, summon Orbeck and open the gates to the boss
arena to summon Sirris as well. Lead your army to where Albert, Kamui, and
Kriemhild are located and defeat the trio. After defeating the trio, use the
Black Crystal of Separation to send any surviving NPC phantom home. Quit to
menu, load your game again, and Orbeck and Sirris' summon signs should appear
again.

The area boss is a pair known as the Twin Princes. Buff your Raw Broadsword+10,
or Raw Dragonslayer's Axe+10, with Gold Pine Resin/Bundle. Cast Tears of Denial
as necessary, but do so prior to initiating the boss fight. Equip the Flame
Stoneplate Ring and consume a Red Bug Pellet to boost your fire defense. During
the second phase, you might want to consume a Blue Bug Pellet to boost your
magic defense. Summon Orbeck and Sirris to help you distract the boss.
