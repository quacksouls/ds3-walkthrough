# Irithyll of the Boreal Valley

This area ratchets up the difficulty another notch. Pontiff Knights are
difficult to handle when using a straight sword, they deal high damage, and can
build up your frost bar. Fire Witches are scattered here and there, but usually
found as ranged fighters within mobs. Two-hand your Raw Claymore and have it
upgraded as high as possible, preferably at least +5. Whenever possible, fight
one Pontiff Knight (or any enemy) at a time. Use your bow or crossbow to lure
one enemy away from its mob. Rime-blue Moss Clump is used to remove your frost
bar, but at the moment in the game you can't purchase it from the Shrine
Handmaid until much later. Prepare at least 10 Alluring Skulls. These will be
used to distract Starved Hounds.

You will advance three quest lines in this area.

1. Anri, who is found near the Church of Yorshka bonfire.
1. Yuria. After exhausting Anri's dialogue, return to Firelink Shrine to exhaust
   Yuria's dialogue. Various statues are found near the Church of Yorshka
   bonfire. Don't attack any of the statues.
1. Siegward. He is found in the kitchen of Irithyll. Exhaust his dialogue, even
   while he sleeps.

Be sure to grab the following items:

-   Dorhys' Gnawing. This item is a guaranteed drop once you defeated the
    Evangelist who kneels by a tree.
-   Ring of the Evil Eye. Exhaust Anri's dialogue, who is found near the Church
    of Yorshka bonfire. While equipped, each defeated enemy would restore a
    small amount of your HP. The Blessed Caestus and Ring of the Evil Eye
    together are effective at HP regeneration.
-   Dragonslayer's Axe. A general-purpose, powerful weapon mostly owing to the
    fact that most enemies in the game are weak against lightning. This weapon
    is guaranteed to drop once you defeated Creighton when he invades you.
-   Undead Bone Shard. This item is found behind a tombstone, in front of which
    is a praying Corvian.
-   Blood Gem. This will be used to infuse the Bandit's Knife. Once infused, the
    Blood Bandit's Knife would be used to fight a difficult boss found in an
    optional area.
-   Excrement-covered Ashes. Give this item to the Shrine Handmaid and you would
    be able to purchase Blooming Purple Moss Clump, an item useful during your
    exploration of another area.

The area boss is Pontiff Sulyvahn, who is more difficult than any of the bosses
you have fought so far. He is a gatekeeper boss, meaning that he is difficult
and you must defeat him as a requirement to progress in the game. Stack as much
physical defense as you can. Consume a Red Bug Pellet to boost your fire defense
and buff your Raw Broadsword with Gold Pine Resin/Bundle. Charcoal Pine
Resin/Bundle are also effective. Pontiff's first attack can always be parried.
Learn to parry the initial attack and practice as many times as necessary until
you are comfortable with parrying Pontiff's first attack. Your character would
die a lot; that's OK. Another strategy involves summoning two NPC phantoms to
help you distract the boss.
