# The Dreg Heap

This is the first area of The Ringed City DLC. You must get past this area
before reaching The Ringed City proper. You have two ways to access The Dreg
Heap:

1. Defeat Friede in the Ashes of Ariandel DLC and two bonfires would spawn. One
   is the Sister Friede bonfire. The other warps you to The Dreg Heap.
1. Defeat all four Lords of Cinder: Abyss Watchers, Yhorm, Aldrich, and Twin
   Princes. Then return to Firelink Shrine and place the four Cinders of a Lord
   on their respective thrones. Sit at the bonfire, be warped to the flameless
   version of Firelink Shrine, and find a bonfire that warps you to the Kiln of
   the First Flame. Light the Kiln of the First Flame bonfire. Locate a nearby
   bonfire that warps you to The Dreg Heap. One disadvantage of exploring The
   Ringed City DLC first is that, when you later explore the Ashes of Ariandel
   DLC, you won't be able to summon Gael to co-op with you against Friede.
   Complete the Ashes of Ariandel DLC first, then move on to The Ringed City
   DLC.

As shown in the above video, once you've reached the Earthen Peak Ruins bonfire
you should first advance Lapp's questline before locating the next bonfire.
Finding the next bonfire is a dangerous task because Angels would constantly
shoot miracle beams from above. The video above shows a shortcut to the next
bonfire. The Dreg Heap and its neighbouring area Earthen Peak Ruins are
dangerous due to the following reasons, among others:

1. Harald Legion Knight. Each Harald is extremely tanky, deals substantial
   damage, and has a massive HP pool. A Harald is susceptible to plunge attack
   and weak against lightning. Equip the Silvercat Ring before performing the
   plunge attack.
1. Murkman. Each is weak against lightning and easily defeated by itself, but is
   usually found in hordes. Some Murkmen are mages who, once transformed into
   giant monstrous Humanity sprites, can one- or two-shot you. A sorcerer
   variant is distinguished by the staff it holds. Generally, you should kill
   the sorcerer Murkmen first before focusing on other Murkmen, otherwise the
   sorcerer(s) would continue to summon more Murkmen.
1. Angel. The most dangerous type of enemy in The Dreg Heap and Earthen Peak
   Ruins. Its miracle beams can rapidly drain your HP bar, but worst of all is
   that it can inflict curse to potentially one-shot you. Three Angels are found
   scattered throughout the area: one in The Dreg Heap; two in Earthen Peak
   Ruins. Each Angel is controlled by a summoner. Defeat the summoner and the
   corresponding Angel would not respawn. The first Angel and its summoner can
   be dispatched of easily as shown in the above video. The Angels at Earthen
   Peak Ruins are substantially more dangerous. As shown in the above video and
   the video below, cast Magic Barrier, equip the Magic Stoneplate Ring, and
   consume a Blue Bug Pellet to boost your magic defense against an Angel.
1. Zoey. A pyromancer who is tricky to defeat, more so because of her Thrall
   bodyguards.

Prepare yourself as follows:

-   Purchase Magic Barrier from Irina, after giving her the Braille Divine Tome
    of Lothric. You have also collected Great Magic Barrier near the Great
    Belfry bonfire, but this miracle requires 25 Faith to use. Magic Barrier
    requires only 15 Faith, which you should have by now.
-   Stock up on Gold Pine Resin/Bundle. All enemies in The Dreg Heap and Earthen
    Peak Ruins are weak against lightning. Also use this item during the fight
    against the area boss.
-   Stock up on Blue Bug Pellet. Consume this to boost your magic defense
    against the Angels. Use the item in conjunction with Magic Stoneplate Ring
    and Magic Barrier to substantially boost your magic defense.
-   (Blooming) Purple Moss Clump. Earthen Peak Ruins has a swamp area that
    inflicts poison.
-   Stock up on Red Bug Pellet. Use this item to boost your fire defense when
    you fight the area boss.

Be sure to collect the following items:

-   Ring of Steel Protection+3. Collect this item after defeating the summoner
    of the first Angel you encounter. Collect the ring and equip it immediately
    to boost your physical defense.
-   Covetous Silver Serpent Ring+3. Found adjacent to a building infested with
    hordes of Murkmen. You must traverse the building to reach the ring. Use the
    Covetous Silver Serpent Ring+3 whenever you want to farm souls.
-   Lothric War Banner. An item whose weapon art can boost your damage output by
    15%. The weapon requires 14 Strength and 14 Dexterity to wield, both of
    which you should already have.
-   Ring of Favor+3. Found on a giant tree branch above a Harald. A Thrall is
    waiting nearby to ambush you.
-   Titanite Slab. A gift from Lapp. First, exhaust Lapp's dialogue at The Dreg
    Heap and make your way to the Earthen Peak Ruins bonfire. Warp back to this
    same bonfire for Lapp to spawn nearby; he should be sitting. Exhaust his
    dialogue again, then warp back to the same bonfire three more times. When
    you see Lapp standing, exhaust his dialogue to receive a Titanite Slab. Then
    talk to him again.
-   Small Envoy Banner. This item is required to access The Ringed City itself.
    The item can only be collected after defeating the area boss.

## Demon Prince

Cast Tears of Denial before entering the boss arena. Phase one is a gank fight
against the Demon in Pain and the Demon from Below. Before entering the boss
arena, summon Lapp and Gael to help you distract the Demon from Below. The Demon
in Pain should be defeated first so that the second phase of the boss fight
would be more manageable. Equip the Flame Stoneplate Ring and consume a Red Bug
Pellet to boost your fire defense. Buff your Raw Dragonslayer's Axe+10 with
lightning to help you first defeat the Demon in Pain, followed by the Demon from
Below. At the start of phase two, consume another Red Bug Pellet and buff your
weapon again with lightning.
