# Consumed King's Garden

Prior to visiting the Consumed King's Garden, ensure you have 18 Strength and 14
Dexterity as a prerequisite to properly wield the Dragonslayer's Axe. Use the
routes shown in the videos below to farm as many souls as necessary to level up.
Upgrade the Dragonslayer's Axe to at least +6 and infuse the weapon with a Raw
Gem (provided you have this gem). Stock up on at least 10 Blooming Purple Moss
Clumps.

The Consumed King's Garden is an optional area, but defeating the area boss has
two benefits.

1. You would be able to obtain an item that can be used to access another
   optional area where you can grab an item that allows you to purchase as many
   Titanite Chunks as you want (among other upgrade materials).
1. Progressing through the Consumed King's Garden is required as part of
   Hawkwood's questline.

In the Consumed King's Garden, ensure you grab these items:

-   Estus Shard
-   Titanite Chunk x 4

The most dangerous types of enemies are Pus of Man and Cathedral Knight. Use the
strategies shown in the above video to easily defeat these enemies.

The area boss is Oceiros. This boss is weak against lightning, therefore your
Dragonslayer's Axe is effective against him. You should upgrade your
Dragonslayer's Axe to at least +7. Stack as much physical defense as possible,
summon Hawkwood to help you distract the boss, and buff your weapon with Gold
Pine Resin/Bundle.
