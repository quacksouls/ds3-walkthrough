# Soul of Cinder

Soul of Cinder is the final boss of the game. He is weak against lightning. Cast
Tears of Denial prior to entering the boss arena, buff your Lothric Knight
Greatsword+10 with lightning, and consume a Red Bug Pellet to boost your fire
defense. To complete Yuria's questline, you must summon her to help you fight
the boss and ensure that Yuria survives the fight. Also summon Londor Pale Shade
if you want. The boss can inflict poison on you; have some Purple Moss Clumps
ready.

After defeating the boss, don't light the bonfire in the arena. You want to
remain in the current game cycle, which is NG+0, and do whatever else you need
to do such as stocking up on items or farm for items and weapons. Lighting the
bonfire would initiate one of several possible endings. A cutscene would play,
followed by the credits. You would then be presented with two choices: remain in
the current game cycle (NG+0); or proceed to the next game cycle (journey 2).
Not lighting the bonfire would prevent you from accidentally choosing the option
to move to the next game cycle. In case Yuria survives the fight, return to her
location at Firelink Shrine to collect her Ashes.
