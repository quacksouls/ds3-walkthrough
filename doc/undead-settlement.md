# Undead Settlement

Your immediate objective here is to locate Yoel, exhaust his dialogue, and
accept his services. One benefit of accepting Yoel's services is that you would
be able to level up 5 times with him without having to spend souls for each
level. Your goal is to level up 5 times with Yoel, working towards having 16
Strength and 13 Dexterity so as to properly wield the Claymore. Light the Undead
Settlement bonfire and return to Firelink Shrine. If possible, talk to the Fire
Keeper and level up Dexterity to 13.

Follow these steps to get all 5 levels from Yoel:

1. Talk to Yoel and pump 1 point into Strength.
1. Warp to the Undead Settlement bonfire and suicide your character 3 times. The
   bonfire is conveniently located next to a cliff, which can be used for a
   quick suicide.
1. Return to Firelink Shrine, talk to Yoel, and pump another point into
   Strength.
1. Warp to the Undead Settlement bonfire again and suicide your character an
   extra 6 times until your character looks like beef jerky. This beef-jerky
   appearance signifies that you have 15 Hollowing points, enough for you to
   exhaust the remaining 3 levels from Yoel.
1. Return to Firelink Shrine, talk to Yoel, and level up to 16 Strength (if
   possible). In case you already have 16 Strength, pump the remaining points
   into Vigor and/or Endurance.
1. Sit at a bonfire, warp back to Firelink Shrine, go to Yoel's location, and
   you should see his corpse. Near Yoel's corpse is Yuria. Talk to Yuria and
   exhaust her dialogue. She sells Purging Stones for 4,500 souls each.
   Consuming a Purging Stone would remove the beef-jerky appearance and reset
   your Hollowing point to zero.

Now you should be able to wield the Claymore two-handed. If not, farm the
Lothric Knights and enemies near Vordt's arena and level up to obtain 16
Strength and 13 Dexterity. The following videos show some farming routes:

Grab the Blessed Red and White Shield+1 and equip it immediately. While
equipped, the shield would slowly regenerate your HP. The higher the upgrade
level, the faster the HP regeneration. Don't upgrade the shield yet; concentrate
on upgrading your Broadsword and Claymore. Also grab the Caestus, which is much
lighter than any shield. Later on, you would be able to infuse the Caestus with
a Blessed Gem.

Various tasks must be completed while you're at the Undead Settlement:

1. Grab Loretta's Bone, give it to Greirat, and exhaust his dialogue. Sit at a
   bonfire, warp back to Firelink Shrine, and you should see Greirat curled up.
   Talk to him and exhaust his dialogue. Sit at a bonfire again and warp back to
   Firelink Shrine. Advance Greirat's questline by talking to him again and send
   him to pillage for the first time. Warp back to Firelink Shrine again and
   Greirat should have left the Shrine. Be sure to purchase any items you
   require from Greirat prior to sending him on his first pillage mission.
1. Join the Mound-makers covenant, then defeat Hodrick when he invades you as a
   purple phantom.
1. Befriend the Giant Archer to receive a Young White Branch. Always have this
   item in your inventory for the remainder of the playthrough and never place
   it in storage (unless you know what you're doing). While the Young White
   Branch is in your inventory, the Giant Archer's arrows would not hit your
   character.
1. Rescue Irina and initiate her and Eygon's questlines. You must first grab the
   Mortician's Ashes, give the ashes to the Shrine Handmaid, and purchase the
   Grave Key from her.
1. Rescue Cornyx and accept his services. Return to Firelink Shrine and exhaust
   his dialogue.
1. Help Siegward to defeat a Fire Demon. First, exhaust Siegward's dialogue,
   then fight the demon. After a while, Siegward would rush in to fight as well.
   Be careful not to hit Siegward and ensure he survives the fight. Afterwards,
   exhaust Siegward's dialogue to advance his questline. Also talk to him while
   he's asleep.
1. Grab the Chloranthy Ring+0 and equip it immediately.
1. Grab an Estus Shard and an Undead Bone Shard to upgrade your Estus Flask.

The area boss is Greatwood, who is weak against fire. Buff your melee weapon
with Charcoal Pine Resin or Charcoal Pine Bundle. In case you need an extra
couple of levels before fighting Greatwood, use the farming route shown in the
next video.

Once Greatwood is defeated, Greirat should return to Firelink Shrine and his
stock of wares now compasses many more useful items. You should have also
received the Transposing Kiln from Greatwood's defeat. Give the Kiln to Ludleth
and he would be able to transform boss souls into weapons.
