# Lothric Castle

Before proceeding to Lothric Castle, return to Firelink Shrine to advance the
following questlines:

-   Yuria. Exhaust her dialogue. You would now be able to summon her to help you
    fight the final boss, provided that you don't heal the Dark Sigil.
-   Patches. Purchase anything you require from him. In particular, purchase
    some Black Firebombs.
-   Greirat. Send him on his third, and final, pillage mission. Use the Coiled
    Sword Fragment to warp back to Firelink Shrine again and Greirat should have
    left the Shrine. Prior to sending Greirat on his pillage quest, ensure you
    have purchased anything you require from him. In particular, purchase all
    Twinkling Titanites from Greirat and some Firebombs.
-   Patches. Exhaust his dialogue. Choose the option "Tell him" in response to
    his question. Once Greirat left the Shrine, Patches won't sell you anything
    so be sure to purchase anything you require from Patches then send Greirat
    on his pillage quest. Use the Coiled Sword Fragment to warp back to Firelink
    Shrine and Patches should have left the Shrine. He would return after you
    have defeated the upcoming boss.
-   Eygon. If you haven't talked to Eygon already during his visit to the
    Shrine, exhaust his dialogue now. Then warp back to Firelink Shrine and he
    should have left the Shrine. He should now be able to co-op with you against
    the upcoming boss.

Warp to the Dancer of the Boreal Valley bonfire, climb up the ladder, and
proceed straight ahead.

Stock up on the following items to prepare yourself for Lothric Castle:

-   Red Bug Pellet. Use this and the Flame Stoneplate Ring when you must
    traverse the fire breathed by the two Lothric Wyverns.
-   Rime-blue Moss Clump. This will come in handy when you fight an Outrider
    Knight.
-   Firebomb and Black Firebomb. Purchase Firebombs from Greirat and Black
    Firebombs from Patches. These will be used to fight the two Pus of Man, each
    protruding from the two Lothric Wyverns.
-   Charcoal Pine Resin/Bundle and Gold Pine Resin/Bundle. Note that you
    shouldn't use a fire weapon (or buff your weapon with fire) to destroy
    barrels. Some barrels contain explosives.

Ensure you grab these items:

-   Titanite Chunk x 12. Two are guaranteed after killing a Pus of Man
    protruding from a Lothric Wyvern.
-   Twinkling Titanite x 8. Two are from a Crystal Lizard on an elevated
    platform. Another two are from the Crystal Lizard down below. First, kill
    the top Lizard, followed by the bottom Lizard. Unlike other Crystal Lizards
    in the game, these two Lizards don't respawn even after you quit to menu and
    load your game again. Whatever you do, kill the top Lizard first. Then head
    for the Lizard down below and kill it as quickly as possible, even if it
    means a suicide run. Twinkling Titanites will be used to upgrade a weapon to
    be used against the upcoming boss.
-   Raw Gem. Use this to infuse another weapon as Raw if you want to experiment
    with other weapons.
-   Undead Bone Shard. This is located underneath the bridge near the two
    Lothric Wyverns.
-   Braille Divine Tome of Lothric. Give this item to Irina to advance her
    questline and purchase Tears of Denial from her. The miracle will help you
    throughout the remainder of the game.
-   Knight's Ring. While equipped, your Strength would be increased by 5 points.
    Together with the Carthus Milkring, the Knight's Ring can be used whenever
    you want to experiment with other weapons.

The area boss is Dragonslayer Armour. It's weak against frost so the Irithyll
Straight Sword is effective against the boss. Upgrade the Irithyll Straight
Sword to at least +3. Have at least 20 Firebombs and at least 5 Yellow Bug
Pellets. Consume a Yellow Bug Pellet to boost your lightning defense. Use the
Irithyll Straight Sword against the boss to trigger frostbite, then throw a
Firebomb to remove the boss' frost bar. Rinse and repeat until the boss is
defeated. Sirris and Eygon are available to be summoned to help you distract the
boss.
