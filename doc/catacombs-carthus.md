# Catacombs of Carthus

The Catacombs is an area where difficulty ratchets up a notch due to the
following reasons, among others:

1. Some skeletons must be killed twice for them to remain dead. You can easily
   spot such enemies by the glowing white orbs in their eye sockets. A Blessed
   weapon is effective against such enemies because you need only to kill them
   once by using a Blessed weapon in order to thwart their resurrection. Your
   most effective Blessed weapon at the moment is your Blessed Caestus. In
   general, a Raw Claymore+4 is more than capable of dispatching all skeletons
   at the Catacombs.
1. Some enemies, notably the large skeletons, can build up your bleed bar. Once
   your bleed bar is full, you would lose a substantial chunk of HP. Consume a
   Bloodred Moss Clump as soon as your bleed bar is around 50% full or is nearly
   full. Purchase this consumable from Greirat or farm them from the Lesser
   Crabs in the swamp near the Crucifixion Woods bonfire.
1. The large skeletons can be difficult to fight, especially if you're using a
   straight sword. A two-handed R1 from your Raw Claymore is effective at
   stun-locking them.
1. Traps are dispersed at various locations within the Catacombs. A trap is
   activated by a pressure plate on the floor. Once triggered, a trap would
   shoot two volleys of fire bolts that can hit your character and the PvE. Be
   careful what you step on. Look for protrusions on the ground.

Large skeletons often drop Titanite Shards and sometimes Large Titanite Shards.
If you want, farm these enemies for upgrade materials. Be sure to grab the
following items:

-   Carthus Pyromancy Tome
-   Undead Bone Shard. A hooded skeleton is controlling the Skeleton Boulder,
    inside of which is hidden an Undead Bone Shard. Kill the hooded skeleton,
    wait for the Skeleton Boulder to smash against a wall, and you should see a
    shiny at the location where the Skeleton Boulder is destroyed.
-   Carthus Milkring. Equipping the ring would temporarily increase your
    Dexterity by 3. For now, you should have enough Strength and Dexterity to
    enable you to properly wield the Broadsword and Claymore. Use the Carthus
    Milkring whenever you want to experiment with weapons that require some
    extra Dexterity.

You will find Anri at two locations within the Catacombs: once within the first
half and the second time near the boss arena. Advance Anri's quest line as
follows:

1. Exhaust Anri's dialogue before you head down the long flight of stairs along
   which a Skeleton Boulder rolls. Answer "No" to Anri's question.
1. The second time you would meet Anri is near the bridge to Wolnir's boss room.
   Anri would be standing near a cliff, face in palm. Near the bridge is a lever
   that opens a shortcut. Pull the lever if you want, but after doing so
   immediately proceed to exhaust Anri's dialogue for a second time. Answer "No"
   to Anri's question. Talk to Anri again and choose "Say nothing" as your
   response. If you proceed through the shortcut, Tsorig would invade you as a
   red phantom. You don't want him to invade you while you run to Anri's
   location.
1. Find Horace in Smouldering Lake and defeat him.
1. Talk to Anri a third time and choose "Say nothing" as your response.

After pulling a lever and entering the opened shortcut, Tsorig would invade you.
He is a tank and difficult to deal with at the moment. Refer to the above video
for an easy strategy to defeat Tsorig. Defeating Tsorig's red phantom now means
he would be available to co-op with you against a later boss.

_En route_ to finding Horace, you would encounter a mini-boss: a Fire Demon
similar to the one you fought at the Undead Settlement. As shown in the above
video, an easy way to chip down the boss' HP is to lure it to a mob of
skeletons. Let the skeletons and Demon fight each other. In Smouldering Lake,
grab the following items:

-   Undead Bone Shard. The item is dropped by the Carthus Sand Worm. Use the
    cheese strategy shown in the video to help you defeat the Worm.
-   Shield of Want. To be safe, grab this item after you have defeated the
    Carthus Sand Worm. While equipped, the shield grants an extra 20% souls from
    each defeated enemy. The Shield of Want is useful whenever you need to farm
    souls. The effect of the shield stacks with the Silver Serpent Ring and the
    Symbol of Avarice.
-   As many Large Titanite Shards as you can grab. These are scattered in the
    area in front of where the Carthus Sand Worm spawns. Be careful of the
    Ballista firing great arrows at you.

The boss of the Catacombs is Wolnir. The fight itself is a gimmick fight. You
are meant to break the three bracelets on Wolnir's arms. Buff your weapon with
Gold Pine Resin/Bundle and stack as much physical defense as possible.

Once Wolnir is defeated, you must complete 3 tasks before exploring Irithyll:

1. Defeat the Sulyvahn's Beast while on the bridge to Irithyll. Once dead, the
   Beast would drop Pontiff's Right Eye, a ring that boosts your damage output
   as long as you continue to spam R1 with your sword. Refer to the above video
   for an easy strategy. Light the Central Irithyll bonfire.
1. Advance Sirris' questline by being summoned into her world and help her to
   defeat Creighton. Help Sirris to defeat Creighton, return to Firelink Shrine,
   and exhaust Sirris' dialogue to receive these items: Blessed Mail Breaker,
   Silvercat Ring. It's the Silvercat Ring that we want because while equipped
   the ring would negate fall damage from certain height. Get the ring and equip
   it immediately if you have a spare ring slot. The summon sign appears near
   where the Sulyvahn's Beast spawned provided that:

    - You have given the Dreamchaser's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid and
      exhausted her dialogue.
    - Sat at a bonfire and warp back to Firelink Shrine.
    - Exhausted Sirris' dialogue while she was at Firelink Shrine.
    - Sat at a bonfire and warp back to Firelink Shrine again to make sure
      Sirris left the Shrine.

1. Send Greirat on his second pillage mission. Light the Central Irithyll
   bonfire, return to Firelink Shrine, talk to Greirat, and send him to pillage
   for the second time. Sit at a bonfire, warp back to Firelink Shrine again,
   and Greirat should have left the Shrine. Before exploring Irithyll, you
   should first explore Demon Ruins and defeat Old Demon King. Once Old Demon
   King is defeated, Greirat should return to Firelink Shrine with an enlarged
   stock of wares.
