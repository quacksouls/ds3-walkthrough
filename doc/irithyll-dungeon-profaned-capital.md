# Irithyll Dungeon & Profaned Capital

Irithyll Dungeon is difficult due to one type of enemy: Jailer. Once you have a
Jailer's attention, a red aura would appear around the Jailer and your HP bar
would decrease as long as the Jailer is looking at you. Generally, you should
dispatch of one Jailer at a time. A ranged weapon such as bow, crossbow, or
Throwing Knife should be used to lure a Jailer away from its mob.

Stock up on the following items to prepare yourself for the journey ahead:

-   Bolts or arrows, and Throwing Knife. These can be used to lure an enemy away
    from its mob.
-   Bloodred Moss Clump. Some zombies can build up your bleed bar. Consume a
    Bloodred Moss Clump to get rid of maggots that build your bleed bar and
    hence remove the said bar.
-   Charcoal Pine Resin/Bundle. Zombies are especially weak against fire weapon.
-   Blooming Purple Moss Clump. The swamp of the Profaned Capital can cause
    toxic.

On your way to Irithyll Dungeon, you would be invaded by Alva. Kill him now and
you would be able to pick up his armour set later in the Dungeon.

Make sure you grab these items:

-   Estus Shard. This is found inside a Mimic.
-   Old Cell Key. This will be used to save Siegward.
-   Titanite Chunk x 2. One is a guaranteed drop from the Giant Slave. The other
    is dropped by the Crystal Lizard right next to where the Giant Slave rests
    his head.
-   Profaned Coal. Give this item to Andre.
-   Xanthous Ashes. Give this to the Shrine Handmaid and you would be able to
    purchase Gold Pine Resin/Bundle from her.
-   Undead Bone Shard. This is found right next to the Profaned Capital bonfire.
-   Logan's Scroll. This is a guaranteed drop after you defeated the lone
    sorcerer. Give the Scroll to Orbeck to advance his questline.
-   Jailer's Key Ring. This will be used to unlock a cell containing the
    Prisoner Chief's Ashes and another cell holding Karla.

The two most dangerous types of enemies at the Profaned Capital are: Monstrosity
of Sin and Gargoyle. To fight a Monstrosity of Sin, equip the Gaunlets of
Thorns, wait for the enemy to rise up and pounce at you, immediately roll into
the enemy to trigger it into a riposte state, and riposte. Rinse and repeat as
many times as you want. Gargoyles can easily be defeated as shown in the above
video.

The area boss is Yhorm. This is another gimmick fight because you must use a
specific weapon to kill Yhorm. Enter the boss arena, run to the shiny beside
Yhorm's throne, and grab the shiny. The item is the Storm Ruler, a weapon that
can be used to deal massive damage to the boss. Once he is rescued from jail,
Siegward would also enter the boss room to co-op with you. Ensure Siegward
survives the fight and talk to him once Yhorm is defeated to receive an item.
