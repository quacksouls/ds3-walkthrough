# What's next?

You have finished the game once, completed as many quest lines as possible, and
collected all items you could. Is there any replay value in the game? Here are
some suggestions:

-   Obtain all Steam achievements. The most tedious achievements are those
    involving covenant items. Stay in your current game cycle; don't proceed to
    NG+1. Farm 30 of each covenant item and turn them in at the respective
    covenant to receive your rewards. Refer to the guide below. Various other
    achievements require you to play through the game a few more times. In
    total, you need only to play through the game up to and including NG+2 to
    collect all achievements.

-   Mod your game. WARNING: modding your game and playing online would likely
    result in your Steam account being banned. Only install a mod and play
    modded DS3 if you know what you're doing. As a start, you might want to
    experiment with Cinders mod and/or Convergence mod.
-   PvP and constant invasion. Anyone who wants to play online should install
    Blue Sentinel mod to protect themselves from cheaters. For invasion, use Wex
    Dust mod to help you quickly find a host to invade.

Do challenge runs. Examples include:

-   SL1 run.
