# Crucifixion Woods

Before moving on to the next area of the game, ensure your Claymore is also
infused with a Raw Gem. Refer to the next video for how to farm a Raw Gem.

Crucifixion Woods is where a two-handed Claymore comes in handy. By now you
should have a Raw Claymore upgraded to at least +1.

Advance the following questlines before fighting the area boss:

-   Irina. Grab the Braille Divine Tome of Carim and give it to Irina during
    your next visit to Firelink Shrine.
-   Anri. Talk to Anri and Horace, both of whom are located near the Halfway
    Fortress bonfire. First, exhaust Anri's dialogue. Next, exhaust Horace's
    dialogue. Finally, exhaust Anri's dialogue again. Anri's questline is tied
    with Yuria's.
-   Light the Halfway Fortress bonfire, return to Firelink Shrine, and exhaust
    Sirris' dialogue. Rest at a bonfire, warp back to Firelink Shrine again, and
    Sirris should have left the Shrine.
-   Orbeck. Exhaust his dialogue and ask to learn sorcery. You require at least
    10 Intelligence for him to agree to teach you sorcery and hence relocate to
    Firelink Shrine.

Grab the following items:

-   Estus Shard
-   Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome. Give this to Cornyx.
-   Farron Coal. Give this to Andre.

Near the Crucifixion Woods bonfire is Hodrick's purple sign. When summoned,
Hodrick's purple phantom would attack you and the PvE. Venturing into the swamp
and Heysel would invade you as a red phantom. These two phantoms are difficult
to handle.

Here's an easy trick to help you kill Heysel's red phantom. Walk in the water of
the swamp, staying near the Great Crab located next to the Crucifixion Woods
bonfire. Wait a while for Heysel to invade you. Once she is near your character,
you should be able to see her. Lure Heysel to the area where you found Hodrick's
purple sign. Summon Hodrick and let him fight Heysel for you.

In case Hodrick survives the fight against Heysel, lure Hodrick to the Great
Crab next to the Crucifixion Woods bonfire, and let him kill the Great Crab. Hit
the Crab while it's distracted by Hodrick. If Hodrick survives the fight, lure
him to the other Great Crab, and repeat the cheese strategy. In case Hodrick
survives the fights against the two Great Crabs, lure him to the general area
where two Exile Watchdogs are located. As you lure him to the desired location,
always be close to him but not too far away, otherwise Hodrick would use a Black
Crystal to return to his world. Let Hodrick distract one warrior while you fight
the other.

The area boss is Crystal Sage, who is weak against fire. Use a Raw Broadsword+3
and buff your weapon with Charcoal Pine Resin/Bundle. Equip some armour items
that have high magic defense and consume a Blue Bug Pellet to boost your magic
defense. Eygon's summon sign is available underneath where Orbeck stands. Eygon
is useful during the second phase of the boss fight, where he serves as a
distraction.
