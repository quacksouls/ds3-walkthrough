# Quest lines wrap up & Dancer

Before fighting the next boss, spend some time to wrap up all loose ends at
Irithyll Dungeon. You need to grab some items and rescue an NPC. Refer to the
next video.

Next, wrap up Sirris' questline so she would co-op with you during the fights
against two end-game bosses. You will be summoned into Sirris' world to help her
defeat Hodrick. Beware: the fight is tough because Hodrick hits hard. Here's an
effective strategy. Infuse a Rotten Ghru Spear with a Poison Gem and upgrade the
weapon to at least +6. You might need to farm the Ghrus in front of the Abyss
Watcher's arena. The Rotten Ghru Spear will also be used against a boss in one
of the DLCs, so it's worth your time to farm the weapon. Infuse the Bandit's
Knife with a Blood Gem and upgrade the weapon to at least +6. Start the fight by
using the Poison Rotten Ghru Spear to poison Hodrick. Once he is poisoned, use
the Blood Bandit's Knife to bleed him.

Dancer is another gatekeeper boss. You must defeat her in order to access the
end-game bosses and finish the game. Her attacks can be difficult to dodge,
meaning that you should use a shield whenever you're not comfortable dodging an
attack. Use a shield that has high physical and fire defense, but also keeps
your weight ratio below 70%. The Dragon Crest Shield is recommended; upgrade
this shield to at least +4. Stack as much physical and fire defense as possible.
Consume a Red Bug Pellet and buff your Raw Broadsword with Gold Pine
Resin/Bundle.
