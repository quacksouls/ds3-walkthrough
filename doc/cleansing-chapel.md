# Cleansing Chapel

Before moving on to the next area, return to Cemetery of Ash. Spend some time
fighting the mini-boss: Ravenous Crystal Lizard. You will encounter this
mini-boss several more times during the course of your playthrough.

Purchase the following items from the Shrine Handmaid:

-   Bandit's Knife. While two-handing, use its weapon art to help you easily
    traverse swamp areas. The Cleansing Chapel has two swamp areas where the
    weapon art of the Bandit's Knife is useful. A Dagger has the same weapon art
    and is less expensive than the Bandit's Knife. However, the Bandit's Knife
    is useful against various bosses so it's worth your time to farm enough
    souls to purchase the weapon now.
-   Torch. The graveyard area near the Cleansing Chapel is rife with zombies
    whose maggots can cause bleed. While equipping the Torch in your left hand,
    maggots won't be able to build up your bleed bar. You must be able to see
    the Torch in the left hand of your character. Another way to remove your
    bleed bar is to consume a Bloodred Moss Clump. At this stage in the game,
    you don't need to purchase this consumable item. Spend your souls on a Torch
    instead.
-   Undead Hunter Charm. You must first give the Paladin's Ashes to the
    Handmaid. Use an Undead Hunter Charm to allow you to easily fight the Mimic
    found within the Cleansing Chapel and other Mimics scattered throughout the
    game.
-   Charcoal Pine Resin and Charcoal Pine Bundle. Zombies and most enemies at
    the Cleansing Chapel are weak against fire. The area boss is also weak
    against fire. Stock up on Charcoal Pine Resin/Bundle.

Warp to the Crystal Sage bonfire and make your way to the Cathedral of the Deep
bonfire, from whence you push forward to the Cleansing Chapel bonfire. Gael is
prostrating near the Cleansing Chapel bonfire. Don't talk to him yet. Light the
Cleansing Chapel bonfire, proceed through the area, and find some ways to open
the two shortcut doors near that bonfire.

Grab the following items:

-   Paladin's Ashes. This is located near the Cathedral of the Deep bonfire and
    guarded by an enemy.
-   Estus Shard
-   Undead Bone Shard
-   Lloyd's Sword Ring. While equipped, as long as your HP bar is at least 98%
    full you would receive a 10% bonus to your damage output. Grab this ring and
    equip it immediately.
-   Deep Braille Divine Tome. Don't give this tome to Irina, otherwise her
    questline would be ruined and Eygon would be hostile against you.
-   Deep Ring. Guaranteed to drop once you killed the lone deacon near a
    buttress.
-   Blessed Gem. This will be used later on to infuse your Caestus. A Blessed
    Caestus would slowly regenerate your HP, but unlike the Blessed Red and
    White Shield+1 a Caestus is lighter on your weight ratio.

Defeating the two Giant Slaves would provide you with enough Large Titanite
Shards to upgrade your Raw Broadsword to +4. You will meet Patches and Siegward.
Proceed with their questlines as shown in the above video to have Patches be
your merchant. It's OK to light the Rosaria's Bedchamber bonfire, but don't talk
to Rosaria to ensure that you don't ruin Sirris' questline.

The area boss is a gang known as the Deacons of the Deep. The boss is weak
against fire and can easily be distracted by Alluring Skulls. Have at least 10
Alluring Skulls. Purchase them from Patches if you need any more. Anri and
Horace's summon signs are located near the boss arena. Summon them to help you
fight the boss. Consume a Red Bug Pellet and equip the Flame Stoneplate Ring to
boost your fire defense.

Having defeated the Deacons, return to Firelink Shrine and exhaust the dialogues
of Anri and Horace. Spend some time wrapping up various loose ends as shown in
the videos below.
